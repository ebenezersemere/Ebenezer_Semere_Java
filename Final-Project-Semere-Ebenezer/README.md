## Application Overview

You are responsible for designing and documenting the API and implementing the controllers, service, layering, repository, Java data objects, and unit tests for the application based on the provided database structure.

  -The use of Agile methodology to plan and track your project, an important skill upon which you will likely be evaluated by hiring managers.
